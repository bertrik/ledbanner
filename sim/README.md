ledbanner simulator
===================

This program simulates the led banner, taking input from STDIN just like the
actual ledbanner program, but outputting to a window created using SDL.

Display is 10 times as large (800x80 pixels) so it fits nicely on a typical
desktop screen.

Requirements:
    libsdl2-dev
    
To build it:
    make
